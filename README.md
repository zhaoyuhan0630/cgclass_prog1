# Program 1 2024: Ray casting (Rendering Triangles)
Yuhan Zhao (yzhao66@ncsu.edu, 200559835)

### Basic Information and General:
- The final HTML features two canvases: the left canvas displays the results for spheres, boxes, and "make it your own", while the right canvas consistently presents the results of the Blinn-Phong lighting calculations for Triangles2. The "View Parameters" on the right side allow for adjustments to the Eye Position, Gaze Direction, View Up, View Volume, viewPlaneDistance, and Viewport. Additionally, it includes options to select which results to display on the left canvas: spheres, boxes, and "make it your own".

- Hard shadows is combined with _Make It Your Own_.
  
- Part 1: Using ray casting, render unlit, colored triangles
  Part 2: Using ray casting, render lit triangles
  Part 3: Make it your own: In this part, I will use an image resembling an atomic structure composed of four circles and three triangles, alongside an red ellipse.
